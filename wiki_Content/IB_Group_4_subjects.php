<p><b>The Group 4: Experimental sciences</b> subjects of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme comprise the main scientific emphasis of this internationally recognized high school programme. They consist of seven courses, five of which are offered at both the Standard Level (SL) and Higher Level (HL): Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Design Technology, and, as of August 2012, Computer Science (previously a group 5 elective course) is offered as part of the Group 4 subjects. There are also two SL only courses: a transdisciplinary course, Environmental Systems and Societies, that satisfies Diploma requirements for Groups 3 and 4, and Sports, Exercise and Health Science (previously, for last examinations in 2013, a pilot subject ). Astronomy also exists as a school-based syllabus, particularly exciting if taken alongside Physics. Students taking two or more Group 4 subjects may combine any of the aforementioned.</p>
<p>The Chemistry, Biology, Physics and Design Technology courses will be updated for first teaching in September 2014, with syllabus updates (including a decrease in the number of options), a new internal assessment component similar to that of the Group 5 (mathematics) explorations, and "a new concept-based approach" dubbed "the nature of science". A new, standard level-only course will also be introduced to cater to candidates who do not wish to further their studies in the sciences, focusing on important concepts in Chemistry, Biology and Physics.</p>


<h3>Structure and assessment</h3>
<hr>
<p>All group 4 subjects (except computer science and environmental systems and societies; see below) follow roughly the same format. Each subject has its Subject Specific Core (SSC), i.e., material taught at both the standard and higher levels. Students sitting the Higher Level examination study the Additional Higher Level (AHL) material. Lastly, there is a list of options for each subject from which two are chosen. Higher Level students are sometimes unable to choose certain options that are available to Standard Level students because the AHL already covers it. Ideally, students choose the options based on their own abilities and preferences, but in practice the options are usually chosen by the school (based on the school's scientific facilities as well as the discretion of the instructor). Students spend one-quarter of the 150 hours of SL instruction (240 hours for HL; however, both numbers are merely recommendations and are not enforced) doing practical work in the laboratory. Group 4 subjects at the Standard Level are tailored for students who do not see themselves in further science instruction after leaving the programme.</p>
<p>Assessment of a Group 4 subject comprises the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Internal assessment of the practical work (24%)</li>
<li>Paper 1 – multiple choice questions on the SSC (20%)</li>
<li>Paper 2 – free response questions on the SSC (32% at SL, 36% at HL)</li>
<li>Paper 3 – free response questions on the options (24% at SL, 20% at HL)</li>
</ul>
<p>At the Standard Level, the examinations are respectively 45 minutes, 1 hour and 15 minutes, and 1 hour long. At the Higher Level, they are 1 hour, 2 hours and 15 minutes, and 1 hour and 15 minutes long. Calculators are not permitted for Paper 1, but they (as well as a provided formula booklet and periodic table) are permitted for papers 2 and 3.</p>

The maximum raw mark is 42, which contributes 20% of the course.</p>

<h3>Computer science (2014–2020)</h3>
<hr>

<p>The computer science course was recently updated and moved from Group 5 (as an elective course) to Group 4, becoming a full course, from first examinations in 2014. The structure and assessment of the course has changed to greater emphasize problem solving rather than Java program construction. The curriculum model for the course still differs from other Group 4 subjects however.</p>

<p><b>Topics</b></p>

<p>Standard Level candidates study the SL/HL core (80 hours) and the core of one option (30 hours), while Higher Level candidates study the SL/HL core (80 hours), HL extension (45 hours), an annually-issued case study (30 hours) and the whole of one option (30 + 15 hours). The remaining 40 hours for both Standard and Higher Level comes from the internal assessment component, for a total of 150 teaching hours at SL and 240 hours at HL.</p>

<p><b>SL/HL core</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Topic 1: System fundamentals (20 hours)</li>
<li>Topic 2: Computer organization (6 hours)</li>
<li>Topic 3: Networks (9 hours)</li>
<li>Topic 4: Computational thinking, problem-solving and programming (45 hours)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>HL extension</b></p>

<li>Option C: Web science (30/45 hours)</li>
<li>Option D: Object-oriented programming (30/45 hours)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Assessment</b></p>
<p>There are three external assessment components and two internal assessment components.</p>

<p><b>External assessment</b></p>

<p>Unlike other Group 4 subjects, calculators are <i>not permitted</i> in any computer science examination.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper 1 (SL: 70 raw marks contributing 45% of the course, 1 hour 30 minutes; HL: 100 raw marks contributing 40% of the course, 2 hours 10 minutes) consists of:
<ul>
<li>Section A (about 30 minutes): Compulsory short answer questions on the SL/HL core and (for HL) the HL extension. Some questions are common to HL and SL. The maximum raw mark for this section is 25.</li>
<li>Section B (60 minutes for SL, 100 minutes for HL): 3 (SL) or 5 (HL) compulsory structured questions on the SL/HL core and the HL extension. Some questions may be common to HL and SL. The maximum raw marks for this section is 45 (SL) or 75 (HL).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paper 2 (SL: 45 raw marks contributing 25% of the course, 1 hour; HL: 65 raw marks contributing 20% of the course, 1 hour 20 minutes) consists of 2 to 5 (SL) or 3 to 7 (HL) compulsory questions based on the option studied. For HL, questions in section A (45 marks) consists of the core of the option, which may be common to the SL paper, and questions in section B (20 marks) are based on the extension of the option.</li>
<li>Paper 3 (HL only: 30 raw marks contributing 20% of the course, 1 hour) consists of 4 compulsory questions based on the pre-seen case study annually issued by the IBO.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Internal assessment</b></p>

<p>Both SL and HL candidates must complete the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A computational solution (30 hours, 34 raw marks). Candidates will need to develop a solution for a client to a problem or an unanswered question. This can be in the form of an entirely new system, or an addition of functionality to an existing system. Candidates will need to select, identify and work closely with an adviser, a third-party that can assist the candidate throughout the creation of the product. Candidates will need to complete an electronic HTML cover sheet (not assessed), the product and the documentation of the product (maximum 2000 words in total), including a 2 to 7-minute video showing the functionality of the product. The entire solution and documentation is marked against 5 criteria and is digitally compressed in a ZIP file and submitted for moderation.</li>
<li>The group 4 project (10 hours, 6 raw marks). Candidates will need to complete an interdisciplinary project with other science students. This is marked against the personal skills criterion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both components carry a weightage of 30% (SL) or 20% (HL) of the computer science course.</p>

<h3>Group 4 project</h3>
<hr>

<p>All students of the Diploma Programme in any of these subjects, with the exception of environmental systems and societies, will compulsorily complete an inter-disciplinary and collaborative investigation called the Group 4 project. The Group 4 project assessment is included in the internal assessment marks. Students undertaking two or more group 4 courses will obtain the same mark for all of the courses.</p>
